  # `logs` defines the source of logs, multiline support, and their sourcetypes.
  #
  # The scheme to define a log is:
  #
  # ```
  # <name>:
  #   from:
  #     <source>
  #   timestampExtraction:
  #     regexp: "<regexp_to_extract_timestamp_from_log>"
  #     format: "<format_of_the_timestamp>"
  #   multiline:
  #     firstline: "<regexp_to_detect_firstline_of_multiline>"
  #     flushInterval 5
  #   sourcetype: "<sourcetype_of_logs>"
  # ```
  #
  # = <source> =
  # It supports 3 kinds of sources: journald, file, and container.
  # For `journald` logs, `unit` is required for filtering using _SYSTEMD_UNIT, example:
  # ```
  # docker:
  #   from:
  #     journald:
  #       unit: docker.service
  # ```
  #
  # For `file` logs, `path` is required for specifying where is the log files. Log files are expected in `/var/log`, example:
  # ```
  # docker:
  #   from:
  #     file:
  #       path: /var/log/docker.log
  # ```
  #
  # For `container` logs, pod name is required. You can also provide the container name, if it's not provided, the name of this source will be used as the container name:
  # ```
  # kube-apiserver:
  #   from:
  #     pod: kube-apiserver
  #
  # etcd:
  #   from:
  #     pod: etcd-server
  #     container: etcd-container
  # ```
  #
  # = timestamp =
  # `timestampExtraction` defines how to extract timestamp from logs. This *only* works for `file` source.
  # To use `timestampExtraction` you need to define both:
  # - `regexp`: the Regular Expression used to find the timestamp from a log entry.
  #             The timestamp part must be in a `time` named group. E.g.
  #             (?<time>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})
  # - `format`: a format string defintes how to parse the timestamp, e.g. "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S".
  #             More details can be find: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/time/rdoc/Time.html#method-c-strptime
  #
  # = multiline =
  # `multiline` options provide basic multiline support. Two options:
  # - `firstline`: a Regular Expression used to detect the first line of a multiline log.
  # - `flushInterval`: The number of seconds after which the last received event log will be flushed, default value: 5s.
  #
  # = sourcetype =
  # sourcetype of each kind of log can be defined using the `sourcetype` field.
  # If `sourcetype` is not defined, `name` will be used.
  #
  # ---
  # Here we have some default timestampExtraction and multiline settings for kubernetes components.
  # So, usually you just need to redefine the source of those components if necessary.
